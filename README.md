Official Repository Of PrakritiSense: A Green House Gas Emission Prediction Platform



Prakriti Sense is a machine learning-powered solution designed to predict Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission Factors with improved accuracy and confidence. The project aims to support organizations in measuring and reducing their carbon footprint by providing data-driven insights into emissions associated with different supply chain activities.



ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting emission factors and their associated uncertainty margins using a combination of historical data, input attributes, and Data Quality (DQ) metrics. By modeling the reliability of data sources and characteristics of supply chain elements, Prakriti Sense offers more robust and transparent emission estimations compared to traditional static methods.
